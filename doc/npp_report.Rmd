## Read data

To examine the impact of increasingly dry summers on European beech forests, we want to take a look at yearly NPP as modeled by LPJ-GUESS in the Franconia region of Bavaria.

```{r read_data, echo=FALSE}
tar_load(npp_raw)
head(npp_raw)
```

## Cropping to region of interest

We only want to look at NPP in Franconia so we use crop the raw LPJ-GUESS output to the desired region using a shapefile of Bavarian counties.

```{r wrangle_data, echo=FALSE}
tar_load(shp_franconia)
shp_franconia
```

For each of the three counties that comprise Franconia we now have the corresponding coordinates

## Plotting our results

```{r, npp_plot, echo=FALSE}
tar_load(npp_plot)
npp_plot
```
